Project: getting started with GKE

1. -Confirm that needed APIs are enabled:
	gcloud services enable Kubernetes Engine API Container Registry API --async
2. -Start a Kubernetes Engine cluster:
	(a)first place the assign zone in enviroment variable
	   	export MY_ZONE=us-central1-a
	(b)Start a Kubernetes cluster managed by Kubernetes Engine. Name the cluster webfrontend and configure it to run 2 nodes:
		gcloud container clusters create webfrontend --zone $MY_ZONE --num-nodes 2
	(c)After the cluster is created, check your installed version of Kubernetes using the kubectl version command:
		kubectl version
	(d) View your running nodes in the GCP Console
		gcloud compute instances list
3  -Run and deploy a container
	(a)launch a single instance of the nginx container.
		kubectl create deploy nginx --image=nginx:1.17.10
	(b)View the pod running the nginx container:
		kubectl get pods
	(c)View the new service:
		kubectl get services
	(d)Scale up the number of pods running on your service:
		kubectl scale deployment nginx --replicas 3
	(e)Confirm that Kubernetes has updated the number of pods:
		kubectl get pods
	(f)Confirm that your external IP address has not changed:
		kubectl get services
